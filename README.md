# workshop_java: Java Basics Mini Projects

## STEP 00: BlueJ Installation Guide

What is BlueJ?
    BlueJ is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Java programming, designed specifically for beginners. It provides a simple interface and tools to help users learn and develop Java applications easily.

Installing BlueJ on Ubuntu:
    Using Ubuntu Software Center:
        1· Open Ubuntu Software Center.
            2· Search for "BlueJ" in the search bar.
            3· Click on the BlueJ result and select "Install."
    Using Terminal:
        1· Open a terminal window.
            2· Run the following commands:
                3· sudo apt update
                4· sudo apt install bluej

Installing BlueJ on Fedora:
Using Terminal:
        1· Open a terminal window.
            2· Run the following command:
                3· sudo dnf install bluej
Installing BlueJ on Windows:

Download and Installation on Windows:
    1· Visit the BlueJ download page: <https://www.bluej.org/>.
    2· Click on the appropriate download link for Windows.
    3· Once the download is complete, run the installer.
    4· Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

## STEP 01 : Project Recreation

Now that we've installed BlueJ, it's time to get into work.
    Recreate the CheckYear, Donation, and Variables projects using Java.
     ----> The three projects are to be found at their respective folders, in which the classes are already created
    so it's not needed to be recreated.

## The 'Teclado.java' is not to be touched, since it's needed into every single of those to work

Understand the logic and structure of each project, any question, ask me directly.

## STEP 02 : checkage micro-project

In this micro-project, you will recreate a function to calculate someone's age.
Prompt the user to input the year of birth and the current year.
After inputting this information, calculate the person's age.
Just as simple as that.

## STEP 03 : donation micro-project

This one is a little more difficult, since is needed the comprehension of saving information in Java.
The prompt need to be something like this:

Provide the donor's name:
    Benjamin
Provide the donation amount:
    2500
Do you want to report a new donation? (1 for yes and 2 for no):
    2
Total donation amount: 2500.0
Number of donations: 1

## Remember that all information requiring input must be provided by the user through the interface, not hardcoded

## STEP 04 : variables micro-project

This one is the easiest, you simply need to retain all the age data inputed by the user, and when the user writes '0',
will return the sum of the ages in one line, and at another line the avarage age.

## STEP 05 : To compile and test

To compile and test your project, follow these simple steps:

1· Right-click on the class with a main function.
2· Select 'void main(String[] args)'; this will open the terminal for the project.
3· To check for any errors, try compiling first; the BlueJ terminal will point out any errors in your code.

## To validade, you must at least compile and run two projects with success and have the third one started
